## Project Description
This project involves creating a recipe website with a diverse collection of recipes across various
cuisines, dietary preferences, and skill levels using Spring Boot. Users can effortlessly search, filter, and explore
recipes tailored to their preferences. The platform allows registered users to create personalized
profiles, enabling them to save favorites, share their recipes, and engage with the cooking
community. A visually appealing and user-friendly interface enhances the browsing experience,
incorporating high-quality images and intuitive design elements. Each recipe page offers detailed
instructions, ingredient lists, cooking times, serving sizes, and nutritional information. Community
engagement features such as ratings, and comments foster interaction among users, creating a
vibrant space for sharing culinary experiences.
